### CPSC 120

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-emily/blob/main/part-2/schedule.cc)

    I did Lab 9 by myself because I was absent the day it was assigned. I won't lie I was nervous because i haven't coded a whole lab by myself before. I like Lab 9 the most because I was able to complete a passing lab alone. I mainly liked Lab 9, Part 2 because I was able to create a schedule to prevent two philosopher from eating at the same time.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-jaden-and-emily/blob/main/part-1/sandwich.cc)

    Lab 6 Part 1, was a favorite because it was a pattern program using arguments and strings. It was based on a Mad Lib and you were creating sandwiches. It was a fun simple lab, and I had a great time coding it.
